# Function Transformer in Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a Function Transformer in a machine learning pipeline. The goal is to apply custom transformations to the dataset stored in `dataset1.xlsx` and use these transformations to improve model performance.

## Introduction

The Function Transformer is a tool in scikit-learn that allows the application of custom functions for data transformation. This project focuses on:

- Loading the dataset from `dataset1.xlsx`
- Applying custom transformations using Function Transformer
- Training and evaluating a machine learning model

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following packages installed:

- Python 
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib (for data visualization)
- seaborn (for data visualization)
